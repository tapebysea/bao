# bao
bao is a simple command line utility to write text output to a specified file. To use, first specify the file name you'd like to write, then the string to write to the file. Here's a simple example to get you started;

    bao example.txt "Hello World!"

If the file name or string you'd like to write is multiple words, simply wrap it in quotes('') or double quotes("") as seen above.

# Installation
To install, simply run the following command;

    sudo curl -L -o /usr/bin/bao raw.githubusercontent.com/tapebysea/bao/refs/heads/main/main/bao && sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/bao

# Notes
More features may be added in the future if it makes sense. If you'd like to contribute, please do so. Code may or may not be accepted.
